# GNUProgrammer
A tool to create simple (at the moment) but functioin based algorithm and convert them into other languages. At the moment it can output to VBS, c++ (not very tested)
and Python 2.7. It is good for people learning how to construct algorithms and then see how they look in differnt codes. It is written in GNUstep Objective C 2.0 with
Clang and is only tested on my windows machine and a raspberry pi.


###Installation:
Must have GNUstep and clang installed, then type: `make CC=clang` and hope it works.

###How to run:
Go into the programmer.app folder and On windows: open programmer.exe. On UNIX: run in terminal: `./programmer`
