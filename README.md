# GNUProgrammer
A tool to create simple (at the moment) but functioin based algorithm and convert
them into other languages. At the moment it can output to VBS, c++ (not very tested)
and Python 2.7. It is good for people learning how to construct algorithms and then
see how they look in differnt codes. It is written in GNUstep Objective C 2.0 with
Clang and only tested on my windows machine.
